This add-on mainly works as a template filter to show random example sentences for vocabulary each time a card is viewed.
You just have to put a filter like this in your <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/intro.html">card template</a>:
<code>{{incontext:Front}}</code>
Here, the add-on will show a random English example sentence containing the word in the <code>Front</code> field.
You can specify the language using the <code>lang</code> option:
<code>{{incontext lang=en:Front}}</code>
Currently supported values are:
<ul><li><code>en</code> English</li><li><code>tr</code> Turkish</li><li><code>ja</code> Japanese</li><li><code>ko</code>: Korean</li><li><code>zh</code>: Chinese</li></ul>The default is <code>en</code>.
Sentences are fetched from multiple sources such as https://www.lexico.com/ (for English) and https://sozluk.gov.tr (for Turkish). You can show sentences from only a certain source by using the <code>provider</code> option, like this:
<code>{{incontext lang=en provider=lexico:Front}}</code>
For a list of supported sources, see the <a href="https://github.com/abdnh/anki-incontext/blob/master/src/providers/">providers</a> folder. The identifier of each provider is defined by a <code>name</code> variable inside each provider class. A list of available providers is also shown in the <a href="https://github.com/abdnh/anki-incontext/blob/master/#interface">interface</a>.
More sites and languages will be added in the future. Contributions are welcome!

<b>Importing Tatoeba databases</b>
To make <a href="https://tatoeba.org">Tatoeba</a> databases available for use with the add-on, please see <a href="https://github.com/abdnh/anki-incontext/blob/master/src/user_files/tatoeba/README.txt">this doc</a>.

<b>Interface</b>
The add-on has an experimental graphical interface to manage sentences that can be accessed from <b>Tools &gt; InContext</b>.

<b>Storage</b>
In the first review of a card that has the InContext filter, sentences will be fetched from the language providers and saved in the <code>user_files/sentences.db</code> file. Subsequent reviews will use those saved sentences (if any) and avoid making more requests to the providers. You can anyway update saved sentences manually from the GUI.
